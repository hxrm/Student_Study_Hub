This cloud-based solution ensures data reliability, scalability, and accessibility.

.

User Registration and Password Management on Azure:
Users can seamlessly register within the application using a unique username and password. The application employs a secure approach by storing only the hash of the user's password in the Azure SQL Database. This cryptographic method enhances security by preventing the storage of sensitive information in plain text.

Exiting the Application:
Users enjoy the flexibility to perform various actions within the application hosted on Azure. The application ensures a smooth exit process, allowing users to securely log out, terminate their session, or exit the application altogether. This enhances the overall user experience and ensures the security of user interactions on the Azure platform.
